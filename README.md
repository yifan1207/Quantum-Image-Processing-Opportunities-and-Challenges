# Quantum-Image-Processing-Opportunities-and-Challenges
By training and employing a machine learning model that identifies and corrects the noise in quantum processed images, this model can compensate for the noisiness caused by the machine and retrieve a processing result similar to that performed by a classical computer with higher efficiency
